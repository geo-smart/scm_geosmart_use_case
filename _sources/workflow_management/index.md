# Introduction

(this page is still under development)

There are manay workflow management systems out there. Some typical examples are [Celery](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/getting-started/introduction.html), [AirFlow](https://github.com/apache/airflow), [Cylc](https://cylc.github.io), etc.

Our choice is to use [Geoweaver](https://esipfed.github.io/Geoweaver/) for several reasons: better GUI support, flexible local and remote executor, easier export of code and history, seamless sync and sharing among team members. It has been validated that it can significantly boost team productivity on AI projects.

This guide will walk you through how to use Geoweaver in your class projects.
